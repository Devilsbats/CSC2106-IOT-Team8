## Introduction

### Project Summary
A Smart Car Park Network which allows users to find available parking lots while gaining other information such as temperature of the parking lots, allowing drivers to ensure the least deterioration towards their vehicles when parking them.
### Research 
we were recommended to implement 2 LoRa Networks, LoRaWAN and LoRa Mesh to determine which of the 2 is better for the communication between Car Parks

## LoRaWAN
In the LoRaWAN file, it contains the LoRaWAN Folder <br>
&emsp; |__LoRaWAN Code for Maker UNO <br>

&emsp; |__Painless Mesh Folder configured for LoRaWAN <br>

&emsp;&emsp; |__"Central" Node code for M5StickCPlus connecting to LoRA Module <br>
